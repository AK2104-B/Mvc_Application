A table of users displayed on a separate page is a common approach for presenting user data in a tabular format. This type of table is often used in user management systems, admin panels, or directories where it's necessary to view and manage a large number of users.

The table typically includes columns representing different attributes or properties of the users, such as name, email, username, role, and registration date. Each row in the table corresponds to a specific user, displaying their information in a structured and organized manner.

The user table may offer functionality to sort the data by various columns, search for specific users, and potentially include pagination if there are a significant number of users to display. Additionally, actions like editing user details, deleting users, or assigning roles can be incorporated as interactive features within the table.

When designing a table of users, it's important to consider the user experience by ensuring the table is visually appealing, responsive, and easy to navigate. Providing clear column headers, appropriate spacing, and responsive design for different devices can enhance usability. Furthermore, incorporating features like filtering, bulk actions, and export options can improve the functionality and efficiency of managing user data.

Overall, a well-designed table of users on a separate page helps administrators and system operators efficiently view, manage, and interact with user data, streamlining user management processes.
